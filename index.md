### Proccessing

All projects contain executables in windows, mac, and linux. If there is no mac executable folder showing, then the program was originally exported through mac.

All of the following programs were created using the Processing application. Click here if you have not downloaded the 
[Processing App](https://processing.org/download/).

#### SpaceGame

An OOP Space Shooter game made in Processing. Deeper understanding of OOP and classes. OOP used extensively within this application.

-note-: You may have to download the Proccessing Sound Library if you haven't already.

#### Etch-a-sketch

Cute and simple drawing tool. First look at user-input.

-note-: This program uses the number pad as its controls. You are able to use the number row, but it may be too confusing.
